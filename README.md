Notes from Introduction to Lens Design 
======================================

This repository contains my own notes made from the book 
["Introduction to Lens Design" by Joseph M. Geary](http://www.willbell.com/TM/lens_design/index.htm), some miscellaneous notes on Zemax, and some notes based on Zemax knowledgebase articles (with proper links and attribution of course). I have used [Zemax](http://www.zemax.com), [PyZDDE](https://github.com/indranilsinharoy/PyZDDE), and [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) for creating these notes.

Goal
----
1. The primary purpose of these notebooks is to be an online reference for my own personal use. 
2. A secondary purpose of these notebooks is to demonstrate the use of PyZDDE with the IPython notebook. I strongly believe that this can be a great tool for making personal notes on lens design, communicating ideas about lens design and optics in general, and for teaching.
3. The purpose of sharing the notebooks is that others who may find it useful, and come up with better ideas about using PyZDDE and IPython notebooks for optics/Zemax/lens-design.
