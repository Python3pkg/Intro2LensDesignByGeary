      "* Zemax always use the full Snell's law i.e. $n_1 sin \\theta_1 = n_2 sin \\theta_2$ for real ray-tracing (and not the linear approximation) [[1](#r1)]. In fact, it uses the vector form of the Snell's law: $n_1 (N\u00a0\\times\u00a0k_1) = n (N\u00a0\\times\u00a0k)$ where\u00a0$N$\u00a0is the unit normal vector of the surface at the point of intersection, and\u00a0$k$\u00a0is the ray direction cosine vector [[2](#r2)].\n",
      "* Zemax uses the linear approximation ($n_1 \\theta_1 = n_2 \\theta_2$) to calculate paraxial quantities such as focal length, pupil plane locations and sizes, system magnification, etc. These are also known as first-order or paraxial approximations.\n",

      "1. Global vertex report: Before starting on CBs, open the prescriptio file and make/keep a note of the position/ vertices and orientation of all surfaces (especially the image surface).\n",

Note that the surfaces after the second CB, should retain their vertex positions and orientations as it was before CB was applied. \n",

      "    - Use a dummy surface just after the second CB. \n",
      "    - Use a position solve (on the thickness of the surface before the second CB) to track back through all the surfaces.\n",
